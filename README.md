Performance-based reward system for open source contributions.


## Open Source Contribution Reward System
This project aims to create a performance-based reward system for open source contributions. It includes tools for grant allocation, issue prioritization, and payout distribution based on the difficulty and impact of contributions. The system features:

**Grant Allocation Agent:** Estimates rewards per issue based on priority, discussion, and difficulty.

**Code Evaluation:** Optionally evaluates PR difficulty using LLM for accurate reward calculation.

**Payout System:** Automates reward distribution using AgentKit after PR merging.

**Owner Dashboard:** Allows repo owners to add repos, submit grants, and track allocation/payout details.

**User Dashboard:** Displays contributed issues, projects, and payouts for individual contributors.

Ideal for open source maintainers and contributors seeking a fair and transparent reward system. Contributions welcome!
